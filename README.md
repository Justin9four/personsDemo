# personsDemo
A Spring Boot Demo for REST

## To Run the Application
Create a JAR. In terminal run `mvn clean package`.
Run JAR with command `java -jar ./target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
>  OR alternatively run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` no need to create the JAR.

## Note
I was not able to meet all requirements. I did not get to Unit Tests and just started handling exceptions.
Other Todo to split the data into two tables, persons and addresses, and add redundancy in the endpoint for unique name requirements.
I thought about making an openapi doc for the endponts.
