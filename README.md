# personsDemo
A Spring Boot Demo for REST

## To Run the Application
Create a JAR. In terminal run `mvn clean package`.
Run JAR with command `java -jar ./target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
>  OR alternatively run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` no need to create the JAR.

## Note
Will add more Unit Tests later, but I have several in place. mvn clean package or mvn clean install will run the tests.
